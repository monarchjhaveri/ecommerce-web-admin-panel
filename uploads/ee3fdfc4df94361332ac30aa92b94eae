Between us, Zero Projects Inc., and you, Scrypter, Inc.

## Summary: 

We’ll always do our best to fulfil your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text because we have no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What we do want is what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.

So in short;

You (Scrypter, Inc.), are hiring us (Zero Projects Inc.) as independent contractors to design and develop software for you at the hourly rate of $37.50 U.S. Dollars per hour as outlined in our previous correspondence. There are lots of little details, but we’ll get to that.

## What do both parties agree to do? 

*Us:* We have the experience and ability to do everything we’ve agreed with you and we’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. We’ll endeavour to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of that we'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give us. We will strive to involve you in the development process, and to keep you informed about the work we will do for you in a regular fashion. By the end of this contract, we will have committed all final source code developed for you to your Git repository.

*You:* You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You’ll give us the assets and information we tell you we need to complete the project. You’ll do this when we ask and provide it in the formats we need. You’ll review our work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner. Deadlines work two ways, so you’ll also be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment details set out at the end of this contract.

## All the details

### Software Development 

We will primarily write HTML, CSS and JavaScript code for your browser-based client-side code, although we may write other types of code (such as PHP) for you as well. We will write this software based on communications with you, on UX designs and wireframes provided by you, and on the current look and feel of your existing user interface and code base.

The UX designs and wireframes you will provide for us should be in a high resolution digital format, as should any photographs or images that you provide. You should supply graphic files (such as icon sets and logos) in an editable, vector digital format.

We will not provide professional design services (such as logo design, graphics creation, or creating static visuals from wireframes) or text content / copywriting services as a part of this contract; however, if you would like us to provide such services, we can certainly do so in a separate agreement.

We will be open and transparent with you about the development process, and we encourage you to be involved at every stage of development. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to review our work and provide feedback. We will commit our code to your private Github (or other Git based) repository that you will provide us access to.

### Project Management

Under the scope of this agreement, we will provide project management services for you at the same hourly rate mentioned above. Such work may include, but is not limited to, bug tracking, project-related communication, task scheduling, documentation, and sprint planning.

### Technical support and bug fixes

For the duration of this contract, we will be available for technical support and bugfixes should things go wrong in the code that we write. However, we don’t offer support for hosting, email or other services relating to hosting.

### Deployments and databases

While we may maintain a staging and/or testing server for internal development purposes, we will not manage your production database(s) nor your production server(s). Any deployments to your production environment should be done by you.

### Terminating this contract

Either party may decide to terminate this contract at any time. 

At the end of this contract, we will hand over any work that we have done for you by committing it to the Git repository mentioned elsewhere in this contract. If we have created any documentation that is not committed to the Git repository, we will hand that over to you via email or some other electronic medium.

At the end of this contract, you must pay us in full for everything we’ve produced for you until that point, at the hourly rate mentioned above.

### Legal stuff 

We can’t guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised us of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

### Copyrights 

First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by yourselves, or that you have permission to use them.

At the end of this contract, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:

You’ll own the source code that we create for this project. The source code will be committed directly to your private Github account, and you should keep it safe because we’re not required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns them.

### Displaying our work 

Showing off our work helps us grow our business, so we reserve the right to identify you as our current or past client, display your company logo and name, and portray all aspects of the work we do for you, including screenshots, on our portfolio and in articles on websites, in magazine articles and in books. We may do this in perpetuity even after the end of this agreement.

### Payments

We issue invoices electronically. Our payment terms are 7 days from the date of invoice. All amounts are quoted in U.S. Dollars. 

You agree to pay all charges associated with international transfers of funds. We reserve the right to charge interest on all overdue debts at the rate of 1.5% per month or part of a month.

### The small print

You can’t transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place. 

This agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable in Ontario. This contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the province of Ontario.
